## E-MARS: Enhanced MARS Assembler

[MARS][1] is a lightweight interactive development environment (IDE) for programming in MIPS assembly language, developed by [Pete Sanderson][4] (programming) and [Ken Vollmar][5], intended for educational-level use with Patterson and Hennessy's Computer Organization and Design.

**EMARS** (this repo) is Azalea's enhanced version of MARS.

## Changes from Mars 4.5:

### EMARS 4.7

* Switched to Gradle build system with Kotlin support
* Added `--open` command-line option to open a file on start
* Added **Keyboard++**: Enhanced keyboard events
* Refactored many classes in Kotlin
* A LOT of [optimizations](https://github.com/hykilpikonna/EMARS#optimizations)

## FAQ

**How to run:** Install Java JDK >11 and double-click on the jar.  
**How to compile:** `gradle shadowJar`

## Modifications needed

1. To use **Bitmap Display++**, please add the following code at the end of each render loop:

```asm
# Tell the display to update
lw   $t8, ADDR_DISPLAY
li   $t9, 1
sw   $t9, 0($t8)
```

## Keyboard++

![Demo](img/bitmap_display_plus_plus.png)

Mars' MMIO Keyboard can only send one key event at any given time, and key repeats are handled by the operating system running Java, which is very bad for controlling a game because of the delay and inconsistency introduced.

So I developed the enhanced **Keyboard++** with additional features:

* **14 simultaneous key events!**  
(MARS 4.5 can read only 1 key at a time)
* **Fine control of separate key-down and key-up events**  
(MARS 4.5 can only read keys typed)
* **Use 2-byte key code** instead of 1-byte ASCII char  
(Non-character keys like arrows & F1-F12 can now be read)
* **Filter out system key repeats**  
(Pressing a key for longer will not repeat any event)
* **Use "clear byte"** to indicate if the events should be cleared  
(MARS 4.5 clears the key byte whenever it is read)

### Specification

![Specification](img/img.png)

From the initial address, the first 4 words (16 bytes) represents key-down events (when a key is first pressed). The next 4 words (16 bytes) represent key-up events.

For each event type, the 0x0 byte stores an unsigned integer `n`, ranging from `0` to `7`, representing how many key events are pooled. 

The 0x1 byte tells the keyboard handler whether the events are read by your MIPS program and should be reset. If 1 is written to the 1st byte, then all keys in the current event cycle will be cleared to 0.

From the 0x2 byte to the 0xF byte stores `n` unsigned 2-byte key codes received, in chronological order. (e.g. the 0x2 half-word stores the first key that's pressed after the last reset). The keycodes are the same with the keycodes used in Java's KeyEvent class. I've attached a list of keycodes extracted from the class below.

### Sample

Here's a sample MIPS code that reads events from Keyboard++:

## Optimizations

In MARS, the BitmapDisplay [re-draws the entire canvas](https://github.com/thomasrussellmurphy/MARS_Assembler/blob/c21dd72e8d2e4a51eb24e276c3f39ef1789148f2/mars/tools/BitmapDisplay.java#L496) instead of only the updated pixels whenever any memory address is updated. This makes updating the display very very very slow, taking 12% of all run time.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22280294/201498543-02a74fb4-9f55-45c8-8eaf-6f1531ab02bd.png)


For example, if I loop through the display and change every pixel in my assembly code, the original running time of h∗w will now take h2∗w2, making it take around one second for each update.

Since I can’t easily draw one pixel on update without manual manipulation of AWT Graphics, I changed it so that it treats bit 0 of the memory display as an “update bit,” and only re-draw the screen when the MIPS program sets bit 0 to 1.

After optimizing for this, it runs faster but still not enough for the animation to be smooth. Then, I discovered that most of the running time is used by the backstepper and notifying observers for changes in registers and memory:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22280294/201498548-1e8712ef-79d6-45e9-9d22-096148185c64.png)


By default, MARS will store backstep register file copies each time a register is updated, which takes a lot of time since registers are updated very frequently. So I removed backstepping when the execution speed limit is not set. MARS also notifies all memory observers when a program statement instruction is read from memory, which I also removed because nothing uses the notification from reading program statements.
